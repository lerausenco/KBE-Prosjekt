# Introduction
## User Interface
The image below shows an overview of the user interface for the weldability check tool. The customer uploads a 2D image in addition to parameters for overall size and robot space. This gets analysed and after the customer clicks "submit". The user will then be sent to the results page where he has an option to recieve the reuslts on mail as well as just getting them in the browser.
